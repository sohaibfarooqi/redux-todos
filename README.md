# Redux Todos

This project is [Sample Application](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) from Redux docs. It covers basic redux concepts like reducer functions, action creators, components and containers.
Though it is a small application, but really nice point to start working with redux together with
react. It currently uses webpack to run in browser.
